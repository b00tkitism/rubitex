# Rubitex

Rubitex is a **Ruby** wrapper around the **Nobitex v2 API** (`apiv2.nobitex.ir`).  
It’s primarily a learning project—**not production-ready**—but it aims to be tidy, tested, and easy to extend.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This library is for personal learning. Endpoints, error handling, and security hardening are incomplete. **Do not use in production.**

## ⏳ Planned

- Typed responses (structs) & better error types
- Retries, backoff, and rate-limit awareness
- Test suite (RSpec + VCR) & CI
